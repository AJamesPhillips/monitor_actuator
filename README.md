# Monitor Actuator

A repo to contain code for setting up and running a system(s) for aiding in
monitoring and actuating.

Example use cases include:

* temperature monitor(s) for warning fridge/freezer failure
* webcam(s) for taking periodic photos of the lab as extra aides to protecting
  the occupants and the space, as well as potential usage stats to inform
  debate.
* sense RFID
* enabled / disable equipment

## TODO

- [ ] Add streaming of multiple data to same plotly graph
- [ ] Handle and recover from the following error:

## Deploying

### Private values

Private values live in the `private/` directory include things such as your
inventory file for deployment and credentials for various services.
You will need to edit the `*.template*` files before being able to deploy the
code.  We recommend you run `git init` inside the `private/` directory and
commit private credentials / config to a private repository.

### Activate Ansible

    $ source deploy/ansible/hacking/env-setup


## Temperature logger

### Option 1: ADC

Built for raspberry pi zero with [ADC board from ABElectronics](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/69/ADC-Pi-Zero-Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter)
5V from board Vcc used in voltage divider with 9.4 k ohm and the thermister.
TODO, electrical implementation should use a voltage reference instead of 5V
from the board.

### Option 2: Digital DS18B20

1-Wire DS18B20
Buy from ebay, Â£11 for 5: [5pcs DS18b20 Waterproof Temperature Sensor Thermal Probe Thermometer Durable 2M](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/162158276878)
Using these instructions
Wire up RED=Vcc BLACK=GND WHITE/YELLOW=SIG so that Vcc is 5V supply and Sig is GPIO4
Add lines to end of /etc/modules:
w1-gpio
w1-therm




### Deploy logger

    $ ansible-playbook deploy/playbook_temperature_sensor.yml -i private/deploy/inventory

### Start logger

    raspberrypi:~ $ nohup python3 -m monitor_actuator.src.temperature_sensor.log_temperature &


## Tests
